# Ghost Blank

Ghost Blank is – guess what! – a blank theme for the publishing platform [Ghost](http://ghost.org/). It contains all necessary files for your own theme design including templates for homepage and posts and a CSS file with custom reset and some basic styling. You’ll also find Modernizr.js and jQuery plus various polyfills to make older browsers behave nicely. Essentially it is based on the [zitrusfrisch HTML-Starterkit](http://http://zitrusfrisch.de/html-starterkit/), a simple, modular HTML5 template to kick off your responsive websites.
